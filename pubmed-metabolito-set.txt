AB  - Tropane alkaloids (TA) are valuable secondary plant metabolites which are mostly 
      found in high concentrations in the Solanaceae and Erythroxylaceae families. The 
      TAs, which are characterized by their unique bicyclic tropane ring system, can be 
      divided into three major groups: hyoscyamine and scopolamine, cocaine and 
      calystegines. Although all TAs have the same basic structure, they differ immensely 
      in their biological, chemical and pharmacological properties. Scopolamine, also 
      known as hyoscine, has the largest legitimate market as a pharmacological agent due 
      to its treatment of nausea, vomiting, motion sickness, as well as smooth muscle 
      spasms while cocaine is the 2nd most frequently consumed illicit drug globally. This 
      review provides a comprehensive overview of TAs, highlighting their structural 
      diversity, use in pharmaceutical therapy from both historical and modern 
      perspectives, natural biosynthesis in planta and emerging production possibilities 
      using tissue culture and microbial biosynthesis of these compounds.

AB  - Plant tissue culture techniques are the most frequently used biotechnological tools 
      for basic and applied purposes ranging from investigation on plant developmental 
      processes, functional gene studies, commercial plant micropropagation, generation of 
      transgenic plants with specific industrial and agronomical traits, plant breeding 
      and crop improvement, virus elimination from infected materials to render 
      high-quality healthy plant material, preservation and conservation of germplasm of 
      vegetative propagated plant crops, and rescue of threatened or endangered plant 
      species. Additionally, plant cell and organ cultures are of interest for the 
      production of secondary metabolites of industrial and pharmaceutical interest. New 
      technologies, such as the genome editing ones combined with tissue culture and 
      Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection, are currently promising alternatives for the 
      highly specific genetic manipulation of interesting agronomical or industrial traits 
      in crop plants. Application of omics (genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) to 
      plant tissue culture will certainly help to unravel complex developmental processes 
      such as organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis, which will probably enable to 
      improve the efficiency of regeneration protocols for recalcitrant species. 
      Additionally, metabolomics applied to tissue culture will facilitate the extraction 
      and characterization of complex mixtures of natural plant products of industrial 
      interest. General and specific aspects and applications of plant tissue culture and 
      the advances and perspectives are described in this edition.

AB  - Plant tissue culture has been used for conservation, micropropagation, and in planta 
      overproduction of some pharma molecules of medicinal plants. New biotechnology-based 
      breeding methods such as targeted genome editing methods are able to create 
      custom-designed medicinal plants with different secondary metabolite profiles. For a 
      long time, humans have used medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes and in food 
      and other industries. Classical biotechnology techniques have been exploited in 
      breeding medicinal plants. Now, it is time to apply faster biotechnology-based 
      breeding methods (BBBMs) to these valuable plants. Assessment of the genetic 
      diversity, conservation, proliferation, and overproduction are the main ways by 
      which genetics and biotechnology can help to improve medicinal plants faster. Plant 
      tissue culture (PTC) plays an important role as a platform to apply other BBBMs in 
      medicinal plants. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation and artificial 
      polyploidy induction are the main BBBMs that are directly dependent on PTC. 
      Manageable regulation of endogens and/or transferred genes via engineered 
      zinc-finger proteins or transcription activator-like effectors can help targeted 
      manipulation of secondary metabolite pathways in medicinal plants. The 
      next-generation sequencing techniques have great potential to study the genetic 
      diversity of medicinal plants through restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing 
      (RAD-seq) technique and also to identify the genes and enzymes that are involved in 
      the biosynthetic pathway of secondary metabolites through precise transcriptome 
      profiling (RNA-seq). The sequence-specific nucleases of transcription activator-like 
      effector nucleases (TALENs), zinc-finger nucleases, and clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated (Cas) are the genome editing 
      methods that can produce user-designed medicinal plants. These current targeted 
      genome editing methods are able to manage plant synthetic biology and open new gates 
      to medicinal plants to be introduced into appropriate industries.

      Biotechnologists.

LID - 309
AB  - Plants are sessile organisms and, in order to defend themselves against exogenous 
      (a)biotic constraints, they synthesize an array of secondary metabolites which have 
      important physiological and ecological effects. Plant secondary metabolites can be 
      classified into four major classes: terpenoids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids and 
      sulphur-containing compounds. These phytochemicals can be antimicrobial, act as 
      attractants/repellents, or as deterrents against herbivores. The synthesis of such a 
      rich variety of phytochemicals is also observed in undifferentiated plant cells 
      under laboratory conditions and can be further induced with elicitors or by feeding 
      precursors. In this review, we discuss the recent literature on the production of 
      representatives of three plant secondary metabolite classes: artemisinin (a 
      sesquiterpene), lignans (phenolic compounds) and caffeine (an alkaloid). Their 
      respective production in well-known plants, i.e., Artemisia, Coffea arabica L., as 
      well as neglected species, like the fibre-producing plant Urtica dioica L., will be 
      surveyed. The production of artemisinin and caffeine in heterologous hosts will also 
      be discussed. Additionally, metabolic engineering strategies to increase the 
      bioactivity and stability of plant secondary metabolites will be surveyed, by 
      focusing on glycosyltransferases (GTs). We end our review by proposing strategies to 
      enhance the production of plant secondary metabolites in cell cultures by inducing 
      cell wall modifications with chemicals/drugs, or with altered concentrations of the 
      micronutrient boron and the quasi-essential element silicon.

PG  - 21-30
LID - 10.1007/s00425-018-2999-2 [doi]
AB  - Maize produces an array of herbivore-induced terpene volatiles that attract 
      parasitoids to infested plants and a suite of pathogen-induced non-volatile 
      terpenoids with antimicrobial activity to defend against pests. Plants rely on 
      complex blends of constitutive and dynamically produced specialized metabolites to 
      mediate beneficial ecological interactions and protect against biotic attack. One 
      such class of metabolites are terpenoids, a large and structurally diverse class of 
      molecules shown to play significant defensive and developmental roles in numerous 
      plant species. Despite this, terpenoids have only recently been recognized as 
      significant contributors to pest resistance in maize (Zea mays), a globally 
      important agricultural crop. The current review details recent advances in our 
      understanding of biochemical structures, pathways and functional roles of maize 
      terpenoids. Dependent upon the lines examined, maize can harbor more than 30 terpene 
      synthases, underlying the inherent diversity of maize terpene defense systems. Part 
      of this defensive arsenal is the inducible production of volatile bouquets that 
      include monoterpenes, homoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which often function in 
      indirect defense by enabling the attraction of parasitoids and predators. More 
      recently discovered are a subset of sesquiterpene and diterpene hydrocarbon olefins 
      modified by cytochrome P450s to produce non-volatile end-products such kauralexins, 
      zealexins, dolabralexins and β-costic acid. These non-volatile terpenoid 
      phytoalexins often provide effective defense against both microbial and insect pests 
      via direct antimicrobial and anti-feedant activity. The diversity and promiscuity of 
      maize terpene synthases, coupled with a variety of secondary modifications, results 
      in elaborate defensive layers whose identities, regulation and precise functions are 
      continuing to be elucidated.

      revealed that many transporters and channels exist in plant genome. Studies of the 
      genetic sequences that encode these proteins, and of phenotypes caused by the 
      mutation of these sequences, have been used to characterize the membrane transport 
      of plant secondary metabolites. Such studies have clarified that membrane transport 
      is fairly specific and highly regulated for each secondary metabolite. Not only 
      genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites but also genes 
      that are involved in their transport will be important for systematic metabolic 
      engineering aimed at increasing the productivity of valuable secondary metabolites 
      in planta.

TI  - Synthetic Biology towards Improved Flavonoid Pharmacokinetics.
LID - 10.3390/biom11050754 [doi]
LID - 754
AB  - Flavonoids are a structurally diverse class of natural products that have been found 
      to have a range of beneficial activities in humans. However, the clinical 
      utilisation of these molecules has been limited due to their low solubility, 
      chemical stability, bioavailability and extensive intestinal metabolism in vivo. 
      Recently, the view has been formed that site-specific modification of flavonoids by 
      methylation and/or glycosylation, processes that occur in plants endogenously, can 
      be used to improve and adapt their biophysical and pharmacokinetic properties. The 
      traditional source of flavonoids and their modified forms is from plants and is 
      limited due to the low amounts present in biomass, intrinsic to the nature of 
      secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Access to greater amounts of flavonoids, and 
      understanding of the impact of modifications, requires a rethink in terms of 
      production, more specifically towards the adoption of plant biosynthetic pathways 
      into ex planta synthesis approaches. Advances in synthetic biology and metabolic 
      engineering, aided by protein engineering and machine learning methods, offer 
      attractive and exciting avenues for ex planta flavonoid synthesis. This review seeks 
      to explore the applications of synthetic biology towards the ex planta biosynthesis 
      of flavonoids, and how the natural plant methylation and glycosylation pathways can 
      be harnessed to produce modified flavonoids with more favourable biophysical and 
      pharmacokinetic properties for clinical use. It is envisaged that the development of 
      viable alternative production systems for the synthesis of flavonoids and their 
      methylated and glycosylated forms will help facilitate their greater clinical 
      application.

AB  - Fungi have consistently been one of the richest sources of natural products, with 
      unprecedented chemical scaffolds and potent biological activities. During the last 
      20 years, pharmacognosy researchers in Mexico, in collaboration with mycologists, 
      have discovered many novel bioactive fungi natural products and new fungal species. 
      To date, more than 100 bioactive secondary metabolites from 20 fungi from different 
      ecosystems throughout Mexico have been documented in peer-reviewed literature 
      according to Scopus and SciFinder databases. These include compounds from different 
      biosynthetic origins and structural cores with the potential for the development of 
      anticancer, antidiabetic, and/or pesticide agents.

TI  - The Vacuolar Transportome of Plant Specialized Metabolites.
PG  - 1326-1336
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcy039 [doi]
AB  - The plant vacuole is a cellular compartment that is essential to plant development 
      and growth. Often plant vacuoles accumulate specialized metabolites, also called 
      secondary metabolites, which constitute functionally and chemically diverse 
      compounds that exert in planta many essential functions and improve the plant's 
      fitness. These metabolites provide, for example, chemical defense against 
      herbivorous and pathogens or chemical attractants (color and fragrance) to attract 
      pollinators. The chemical composition of the vacuole is dynamic, and is altered 
      during development and as a response to environmental changes. To some extent these 
      alterations rely on vacuolar transporters, which import and export compounds into 
      and out of the vacuole, respectively. During the past decade, significant progress 
      was made in the identification and functional characterization of the transporters 
      implicated in many aspects of plant specialized metabolism. Still, deciphering the 
      molecular players underlying such processes remains a challenge for the future. In 
      this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the most recent achievements in 
      this field.

TI  - Coffee Leaves: An Upcoming Novel Food?
PG  - 949-963
LID - 10.1055/a-1533-0021 [doi]
AB  - Unlike those of coffee beans, the healthy properties of coffee leaves have been 
      overlooked for a long time, even if they are consumed as a beverage by local 
      communities of several African countries. Due to the presence of xanthines, 
      diterpenes, xanthones, and several other polyphenol derivatives as main secondary 
      metabolites, coffee leaves might be useful to prevent many daily disorders. At the 
      same time, as for all bioactive molecules, careless use of coffee leaf infusions may 
      be unsafe due to their adverse effects, such as the excessive stimulant effects on 
      the central nervous system or their interactions with other concomitantly 
      administered drugs. Moreover, the presence of some toxic diterpene derivatives 
      requires careful analytical controls on manufactured products made with coffee 
      leaves. Accordingly, knowledge about the properties of coffee leaves needs to be 
      increased to know if they might be considered a good source for producing new 
      supplements. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the biosynthesis, 
      metabolism, and distribution of the 4 main classes of secondary metabolites present 
      in coffee leaves, their main pharmacological and toxicological aspects, and their 
      main roles in planta. Differences in coffee leaf chemical composition depending on 
      the coffee species will also be carefully considered.
